# Translations for Cookie Consent by Devora

This directory contains translations for the Cookie Consent by Devora plugin.

## Available Translations

- English (en_US)

## How to Use Translations

The plugin has a language selector in the Settings page that allows you to choose between English and Norwegian for both the admin interface and default frontend text.

## Custom Translations

If you want to add more languages:

1. Copy the `custom-cookie-consent.pot` file
2. Rename it to `custom-cookie-consent-{language_code}.po` (e.g., `custom-cookie-consent-de_DE.po` for German)
3. Translate the strings in the file
4. Convert the .po file to .mo format using a tool like Poedit or WP-CLI
5. Place both files in this directory

## Default Text Values

Even if you select a specific language, you can still customize all text strings in the "Text & Translations" section of the plugin.
