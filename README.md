## Technical Details

### Cookie Management

The plugin manages cookie consent across four primary categories:

1. **Necessary Cookies** - Required for basic website functionality (always enabled)
2. **Analytics Cookies** - Used to collect anonymous site usage data
3. **Functional Cookies** - Enable enhanced functionality and personalization
4. **Marketing Cookies** - Support advertising and cross-site tracking functionality

Each category can be individually enabled or disabled by the user, with granular control over specific cookies within each category.

### Bot Detection System

The advanced bot detection system uses both server-side and client-side techniques to identify search engine crawlers, including:

- User-Agent string matching against a comprehensive database of known bots
- Behavioral pattern analysis to detect crawler-like activity
- Integration with WordPress core bot detection functions
- IP-based verification for major search engines (optional)

When a bot is detected, full consent is automatically granted to ensure complete site indexing without consent barriers.

### Cookie Scanner Technology

The built-in cookie scanner uses multiple methods to detect and categorize cookies:

- JavaScript-based detection of client-side cookies
- Server-side scanning of Set-Cookie headers
- Integration with common services to identify known cookies
- Pattern matching to categorize unknown cookies based on naming conventions
- Regular expression parsing for cookie value analysis
- Periodic rescanning to detect new cookies

### Data Storage Architecture

Consent data is stored using a multi-layered approach:

- First-party cookies with appropriate security attributes
- localStorage fallback for browsers with cookie limitations
- Server-side storage for logged-in users via WordPress user meta
- Optional database logging for compliance purposes
- Export functionality for audit requirements

## Best Practices for GDPR Compliance

To ensure your site remains compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations, follow these best practices when using the Cookie Consent plugin:

### Granular Consent Implementation

The plugin implements proper granular consent with distinct categories that comply with GDPR requirements:

1. **Necessary Cookies** - Always enabled, essential for basic site functionality
2. **Analytics Cookies** - Enabled only when the user consents to analytics
3. **Functional Cookies** - Enabled only when the user consents to functional features
4. **Marketing Cookies** - Enabled ONLY when the user explicitly consents to marketing/advertising

Each category is processed separately, ensuring that if a user only accepts analytics cookies, marketing/advertising features remain disabled. This granular approach is essential for GDPR compliance, which requires specific consent for each purpose.

### Google Consent Mode Implementation

When using Google services (Analytics, Ads, etc.), proper implementation is critical:

- **Do not** add Google Tag Manager code directly to your site. Instead, enter your GTM ID in the plugin settings to ensure proper consent handling.
- Analytics tracking only begins after the user gives consent for the analytics category.
- Marketing/advertising features (ad_storage, ad_user_data, ad_personalization) are only enabled when marketing consent is explicitly given.
- The plugin correctly separates analytics_storage and ad_storage signals to Google services.

### Recommended Settings

For optimal compliance:

1. **Banner Visibility**: Place the banner prominently at the bottom or center of the screen.
2. **Decline Button**: Always include a visible "Decline All" button that's as prominent as the "Accept" button.
3. **Default State**: Ensure all non-necessary cookie categories are unchecked by default.
4. **Cookie Settings Link**: Add a permanent cookie settings link in your footer using the shortcode `[cookie_settings]`.
5. **Consent Region**: Configure the appropriate region in the settings (Norway, EEA, or Global) based on your audience.
6. **Documentation**: Maintain a detailed cookie policy that lists all cookies and their purposes.

### Common Implementation Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Incorrect Google Tag Integration**: Adding GTM or GA4 code directly to your site instead of using the plugin's integration features.
2. ‚ùå **Pre-checked Boxes**: Having any non-necessary cookie categories pre-selected (this violates GDPR).
3. ‚ùå **No Decline Option**: Making it difficult to decline cookies or hiding the decline button.
4. ‚ùå **Loading Tracking Before Consent**: Allowing scripts to load before user consent is given.
5. ‚ùå **Ignoring Geo-specific Rules**: Not configuring the consent region appropriately for your audience.

### Handling User Consent Changes

When a user changes their consent preferences:

1. The plugin immediately updates the consent state in Google Consent Mode.
2. Previously allowed cookies from categories that are now declined will be blocked from reading/writing data.
3. New cookies from declined categories will not be set.
4. Existing cookies from declined categories should be deleted where possible.
