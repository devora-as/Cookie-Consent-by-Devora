/**
 * Security Best Practices for WordPress:
 * 
 * 1. Always verify nonces for form submissions with:
 *    - wp_verify_nonce() or check_admin_referer()
 * 
 * 2. Always check capabilities before processing admin actions with:
 *    - current_user_can()
 * 
 * 3. Always sanitize input data with appropriate functions:
 *    - sanitize_text_field()
 *    - sanitize_textarea_field()
 *    - absint()
 *    - etc.
 * 
 * 4. Always escape output with appropriate functions:
 *    - esc_html()
 *    - esc_attr()
 *    - esc_url()
 *    - wp_kses()
 *    - etc.
 *
 * 5. Use prepared statements for database queries:
 *    - $wpdb->prepare()
